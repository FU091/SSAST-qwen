Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:
"singularity"

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "singularity"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:478: UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 8 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 4, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.
